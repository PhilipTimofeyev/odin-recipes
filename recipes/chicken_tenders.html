<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>These BBQ tenders have a barbecue base but are elevated with a decidedly Asian influence.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul class="ingredients">
	<li>cooking spray</li>
	<li>⅓ cup barbeque sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray's® Hickory & Brown Sugar)</li>
	<li>1 ½ tablespoons Asian-flavored barbeque seasoning (such as Savory Spice® Asian Delight BBQ Rub)</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon caramel sauce</li>
	<li>1 pound chicken tenders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol class="directions">
	<li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
	<li>Stir together barbeque sauce, barbeque seasoning, and caramel sauce in a shallow dish until combined. Reserve 2 tablespoons mixture for basting.</li>
	<li>Dip each chicken tender into barbeque sauce mixture; coat thoroughly. Place in the prepared casserole dish.</li>
	<li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. Baste with reserved sauce and bake 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
</ol>
